 Create an encrypted attachment object by encrypting the given data

 @param uploader A valid, ready to use media loader
 @param mimeType The mime type of the file
 @param dataLength The length of the data in bytes.
                   The dataCallback block must return exactly
                   this number of bytes in total across all calls.
 @param dataCallback a block called when more data is required.
                     This will be called repeatedly until it returns nil.
                     It is more efficient if this block returns the same
                     amount of data in each call.
 @param success a block called when the operation succeeds.
 @param failure a block called when the operation fails.
