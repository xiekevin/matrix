#import "MXMemoryStore.h"

/**
 `MXFileStore` extends MXMemoryStore by adding permanent storage.

 The data are stored on [MXStore commit] and reloaded on [MXFileStore openWithCredentials:].
 Between them MXFileStore behaves as MXMemoryStore: the data is mounted in memory.
 
 The files structure is the following:
 + NSCachesDirectory
    + MXFileStore
        + Matrix user id (one folder per account)
            + rooms
                + {roomId1}
                    L messages: The room messages
                    L state: The room state events
                    L accountData: The account data for this room
                    L receipts: The read receipts for this room
                + {roomId2}
                    L messages
                    L state
                    L accountData
                    L receipts
                + ...
            + users: all MXUsers known by the user. There are distributed among smaller files to speed up their storage.
                L usersGroup #1
                L usersGroup #2
                L ...
            + crypto: crypto data
                L account: the user's olm account
                L devices: users devices keys
                L roomsAlgorithms: the algos used in rooms
                L sessions: the olm sessions with other users devices
                L inboundGroupSessions: the inbound group session
            L MXFileStore : Information about the stored data
            + backup : This folder contains backup of files that are modified during
                  the commit process. It is flushed when the commit completes.
                  This allows to rollback to previous data if the commit process was
                  interrupted.
                + {syncToken} : the token that corresponds to the backup data
                    + rooms
                        + {roomIdA}
                        + {roomIdB}
                        + ...
                    + users
                        L usersGroup #1
                        L ...
                    + crypto
                        L ...
                    L MXFileStore
